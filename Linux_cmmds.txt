The differences between conda and pip are often misunderstood as both package managers provide similar functionality. On one hand, pip is well-adopted in the Python community and the Python Package Index (PyPI) contains a vast array of packages maintained by the community. On the other hand, Conda is a general-purpose package manager, can help track dependencies for non-Python libraries, and is fully compatible with pip. In general, each package manager compliments the other and you are free to use whichever provides the package you wish to install.
